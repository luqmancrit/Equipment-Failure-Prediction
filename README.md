# ‚öôÔ∏èüß¨Failure Machine Prediction
A classification model that predicts a machine failure types. Possible machine failures:

- No Failure
- Heat Dissipation Failure
- Power Failure
- Overstain Failure
- Tool Wear Failure
- Random Failures

The model are built on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Inbalanced dataset solved using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Cross validation using Stratified Kfolds, SearchGridCV. Model evaluation using Precision/Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and Accuracy.
